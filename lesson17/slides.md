## Guest Speaker - Belle Liu (BeansBox)



## Todo Application Q&A



## Todo Application Q&A

* Note that the additional solutions in directory
	* "simple_solution"
	* "advanced_solution"
* Feel free to dissect (and use as a reference going forwards)
* Appreciate the near infinite ways in which to create apps



## Mobile PhoneGap / Cordova / Ionic



## PhoneGap / Cordova

* "PhoneGap is a free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for the platforms you care about."
* Cordova is the open-source implementation of PhoneGap
* Both allow you to "hybrid apps" (that can be published to app stores) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* You can access the majority of the sensors on the device (Camera, Assisted GPS, Storage, etc)



## Ionic (http://ionicframework.com)

* Builds on top of Cordova and adds a bunch of additional features
* "Focused mainly on the look and feel, and UI interaction of your app"
* Uses Angular JS ("another" JavaScript framework)



##  Creating an app in 4-ish commands

* ionic start app-name tabs
* cd app-name
* ionic platform add ios
* ionic build ios
* ionic emulate ios (requires ios-sim) ionic run android --device



## Ionic in the Real World

* Prototyped using Invision (http://invis.io/YA1BFCKCK)
* Built locally and pushed to devices to test
* Leveraging the new Mobile Tools in Chrome



## Lab - Ionic Framework



## Brainstorming For The Next Class

* Topics (choose two)
	* Anything we've covered so far vs new
	* Data Visualization with D3.js
	* Node.js
	* Client Side Frameworks (Angular, Backbone, etc)
	* Fancy stuff (famo.us, three.js, etc)
	* Working with external API's
	* Anything else?
